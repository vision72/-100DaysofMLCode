Day 0 : 3 January 2019

Today's progress: Cited courses to get basics right for ML.
                  1. Introduction to probability-Science of uncertainity (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2)
                  2. Algorithm Design and analysis.(https://www.edx.org/course/algorithm-design-analysis-pennx-sd3x)
                  Viewed basics from these courses.
                  
Takeaway : Both courses are interesting and looking forward to complete them succesfully.         

Day 1 : 4 January 2019

Progress : 
           
           1.Completed week 1 of course - algorithm design and analysis (UPENN,edx).

           2.Started unit 1 of Science of uncertainity (MIT,edx).

Takeaway :
          
           Week 1 of the course algorithm design was pretty basic , few important data structures were discussed and some important  
           algorithms were analysed.
           
           Unit 1 of the course Science of uncertainity was also basic probability (12th grade).
