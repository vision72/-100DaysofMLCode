# Day 0 : 3 January 2019

Today's progress: Cited courses to get basics right for ML.
                  1. Introduction to probability-Science of uncertainity (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2)
                  2. Algorithm Design and analysis.(https://www.edx.org/course/algorithm-design-analysis-pennx-sd3x)
                  Viewed basics from these courses.
                  
Takeaway : Both courses are interesting and looking forward to complete them succesfully.         

# Day 1 : 4 January 2019

Progress : 
           
           1.Completed week 1 of course - algorithm design and analysis (UPENN,edx).

           2.Started unit 1 of Science of uncertainity (MIT,edx).

Takeaway :
          
           Week 1 of the course algorithm design was pretty basic , few important data structures were discussed and some important  
           algorithms were analysed.
           
           Unit 1 of the course Science of uncertainity was also basic probability (12th grade).
           
# Day 2 : 5 January 2019

Progress : Tried to execute codes from week 1 of algorithms design and analysis.

       Completed unit 1 from Introduction to probability (Solved Problems).
       
       Repository : https://github.com/priyamane/Basic-algorithms
Takeaway : Learnt execution of basic algorithms.

# Day 3 : 6 January 2019

Progress : Completed unit 3 (counting) of course Science of uncertainity.

Takeway : Solved some problems on counting (Revision).

# Day 4 : 7 January 2019

Progress : Started learning week 2 of Algorithms and design.

           Learnt about dynamic programming.

Takeaway : It (Dynamic Programming) is a little different to think of, need more self study to get the concept.
           
# Day 5 : 8 Januaray 2019

Progress : Saw some problems on dynamic programming.

           Learnt about Greedy Alogrithms

Takeaway : Need to see more examples on greedy algorithms  to understand them better but they seem more interesting than dynamic                    programming.  

# Day 6 : 14 January 2019

Progress : Learnt about Dynamic programming.
           
           Learnt about discrete random variables

Takeaway : Want to explore more on Dynamic programming .
