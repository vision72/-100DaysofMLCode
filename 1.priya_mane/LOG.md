# Day 0 : 3 January 2019

Today's progress: Cited courses to get basics right for ML.
                  1. Introduction to probability-Science of uncertainity (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2)
                  2. Algorithm Design and analysis.(https://www.edx.org/course/algorithm-design-analysis-pennx-sd3x)
                  Viewed basics from these courses.
                  
Takeaway : Both courses are interesting and looking forward to complete them succesfully.         

# Day 1 : 4 January 2019

Progress : 
           
           1.Completed week 1 of course - algorithm design and analysis (UPENN,edx).

           2.Started unit 1 of Science of uncertainity (MIT,edx).

Takeaway :
          
           Week 1 of the course algorithm design was pretty basic , few important data structures were discussed and some important  
           algorithms were analysed.
           
           Unit 1 of the course Science of uncertainity was also basic probability (12th grade).
           
# Day 2 : 5 January 2019

Progress : Tried to execute codes from week 1 of algorithms design and analysis.

       Completed unit 1 from Introduction to probability (Solved Problems).
       
       Repository : https://github.com/priyamane/Basic-algorithms
Takeaway : Learnt execution of basic algorithms.

# Day 3 : 6 January 2019

Progress : Completed unit 3 (counting) of course Science of uncertainity.

Takeway : Solved some problems on counting (Revision).

# Day 4 : 7 January 2019

Progress : Started learning week 2 of Algorithms and design.

           Learnt about dynamic programming.

Takeaway : It (Dynamic Programming) is a little different to think of, need more self study to get the concept.
           
# Day 5 : 8 Januaray 2019

Progress : Saw some problems on dynamic programming.

           Learnt about Greedy Alogrithms

Takeaway : Need to see more examples on greedy algorithms  to understand them better but they seem more interesting than dynamic                    programming.  

# Day 6 : 14 January 2019

Progress : Learnt about Dynamic programming.
           
           Learnt about discrete random variables

Takeaway : Want to explore more on Dynamic programming .

# Day 7 : 15 January 2019

Progress : Completed week 2 of algorithms and design.

Takeaway  : Learnt about Huffman coding(prefix codes),knapsack problem.

# Day 8 : 16 January 2019

Progress : Started week 3 (Graph algorithms) of algorithms analysis and design.

Takeaway : Basic DFS, some applications of DFS are very interesting(image segmentation). 

# Day 9 : 17 January 2019

Progress : Binomial Random variables, Geometric Random variables,Expectation of R.V and few examples.

Takeaway : --

# Day 10 : 18 January 2019

Progress : Learnt details of BFS and DFS .

Takeaway : --

# Day 11 : 19 January 2019

Progress : Learnt Minimum spanning tree , Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm -with this completed week 3 for algorithms course.

Takeaway : Both algorithms were difficult to prove and understand, execution is still unclear .

# Day 12 : 20 January 2019

Progress : Started course (https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.101x+2T2017/course/),completed week 1 - started with            week 2

Takeaway : Learnt basic definitions (types of agent,environment)

# Day 13 : 21 January 2019

Progress : Learnt elementay properties of expectation,expected value rule for calculating expectation of y as function of x, Linearity of expectations.

Takeaway : --

# Day 14 : 22 January 2019

Progress : Learnt about types of agent, Agent's organization, Problem formulation (search problems).

Takeaway : problem  formulation for 8 queen problem,8 puzzle problem,maze,etc problems was discussed.

# Day 15 : 23 January 2019

Progress :
