Day 1 : 4 January 2019

Progress : 1.Completed week 1 of course - algorithm design and analysis (UPENN,edx).
           2.Started unit 1 of Science of uncertainity (MIT,edx).

Takeaway :
          
           Week 1 of the course algorithm design was pretty basic , few important data structures were discussed and some important  
           algorithms were analysed.
           
           Unit 1 of the course Science of uncertainity was also basic probability (12th grade).
