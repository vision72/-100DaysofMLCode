# -100DaysofMLCode
This is 100 days of ML code in collaboration with the folks at Mumbai School of AI. It will complement my work
in my own repo github.com/averma12

# Day 1
 Revised on file operations in Python using the os and pathlib modules.
 Also downloaded zip using python and unpacked it. Took reference from the fast.ai library.
 Did eda on data downloaded.
 Day1 trying to do Facial Kepypoints Detection project again from scratch using Pytorch.
 https://github.com/averma12/Beginning_Data_Science/blob/master/Download%20and%20unpack%20requests.ipynb
 
 # Day 2
  Read on Data Augmentation techniques and Image Transforms. Looked at various forms of Data Augmentation techniques. tried to implement some of them in facial keypoints detection. Still working on them. Will update github
   link when complete.
   Links referred to

   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49659236/rotating-keypoints-numpy-array
   
   # Day 3
      Built on day 2 of Data Augmentation techniques.
      Read on histogram equalization,mormalization,Gaussian blurring.
      Found out limitations of techniques I can apply on current project.
      Onwards to day 4 , defining model, data loader.
      https://github.com/averma12/Beginning_Data_Science/blob/master/View%20Image%20and%20Transforms.ipynb
      
  # Day 4
     Introduction to datasets and dataloaders in pytorch. Combining them with transforms.
     Also introduced to databunch in fast.ai. Will look more into it tomorrow

# Day 5
    Read about dataloaders and datasets . Read about fast.ai databunch which is a combination of a dataloader and transforms for passing onto the model. Implementing a MNIST example using a Resblock and the databunch API. To use that later for facial keypoints project
    
    Key Points
    DataLoaders.
    Class Objects and class methods.
    Using on MNIST example.
    Code to follow soon
    
# Day 6
  https://github.com/averma12/Deep-Learning/blob/master/MNIST_ResBlocks.ipynb
  Code completed.
  
  # Day 7
     Travelling Rest Day


# Day 8,9 (10-11 Jan)
  Travelling so no progress


# Day 10
 Completed Type hinting in Python.
 https://github.com/averma12/Beginning_Data_Science/blob/master/Type%20Hinting%20in%20Python.ipynb
 
 
 # Day 11
 Generators and Iterators in Pyhton. Building blocks of dataloaders and datasets. Completed iterator class implementation. Doing generators now.
 
 # Day 12
Generators. Data processing with pandas revision.
Signed up to be School of AI dean . Hope for the best
